    <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 5cqw;">History of Madaris</h1> 
    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 3cqw;"> Early History</h2>
    <h4 style="text-align: center; font-size: 2cqw;">Definition of Madrasa</h4>
<p><h5>  The word madrasah derives from the triconsonantal Semitic root د-ر-س D-R-S 'to learn, study',using the wazn (morphological form or template) مفعل(ة); mafal(ah), meaning "a place where something is done". Thus, madrasah literally means "a place where learning and studying take place" or "place of study".[8][9][5] The word is also present as a loanword with the same general meaning in many Arabic-influenced languages, such as:Urdu, Punjabi, Bengali, Pashto, Baluchi, Persian, Turkish, Azeri, Kurdish, Indonesian, Somali and Bosnian.[10][11]</h5></p>
<p>The first institute of madrasa education was at the estate of Zaid bin Arkam near a hill called where Muhammad was the teacher and the students were some of his followers.[citation needed] After Hijrah (migration) the madrasa of "Suffa" was established in Madina on the east side of the Al-Masjid an-Nabawi mosque.Ubada ibn as-Samit was appointed there by Muhammad as teacher and among the students.[citation needed] In the curriculum of the madrasa, there were teachings of The Qur'an, The Hadith, fara'iz, tajweed, genealogy, treatises of first aid, etc. There was also training in horse-riding, the art of war, handwriting and calligraphy, athletics and martial arts.The first part of madrasa-based education is estimated from the first day of "nabuwwat" to the first portion of the Umayyad Caliphate.[citation needed] At the beginning of the Caliphate period, the reliance on courts initially confined sponsorship and scholarly activities to major centres.[citation needed]</p>
<p>In the early history of the Islamic period, teaching was generally carried out in mosques rather than in separate specialized institutions.Although some major early mosques like the Great Mosque of Damascus or the Mosque of Amr ibn al-As in Cairo had separate rooms which were devoted to teaching,this distinction between "mosque" and "madrasa" was not very present.[7] Notably, the al-Qarawiyyin (Jāmiat al-Qarawīyīn), established in 859 in the city of Fes, present-day Morocco, is considered the oldest university in the world by some scholars,[16] though the application of the term "university" to institutions of the medieval Muslim world is disputed.[17][18] According to tradition, the al-Qarawiyyin mosque was founded by Fāṭimah al-Fihrī, the daughter of a wealthy merchant named Muḥammad al-Fihrī. This was later followed by the Fatimid establishment of al-Azhar Mosque in 969-970 in Cairo, initially as a center to promote Isma'ili teachings, which later became a Sunni institution under Ayyubid rule (today's Al-Azhar University).[19][20][21][22] By the 900s AD, the Madrasa is noted to have become a successful higher education system.[23]</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 3cqw;">Elementary education</h2>
<p>In the medieval Islamic world, an elementary school (for children or for those learning to read) was known as a 'kuttāb' or maktab.Their exact origin is uncertain, but they appear to have been already widespread in the early Abbasid period (8th-9th centuries) and may have played an early role in socializing new ethnic and demographic groups into the Islamic religion during the first few centuries after the Arab-Muslim conquests of the region.[44] Like madrasas (which referred to higher education), a maktab was often attached to an endowed mosque.[44] In the 11th century,
<br> The famous Persian Islamic philosopher and teacher Ibn Sīnā (known as Avicenna in the West), in one of his books, wrote a chapter about the maktab entitled "The Role of the Teacher in the Training and Upbringing of Children," as a guide to teachers working at maktab schools. He wrote that children can learn better if taught in classes instead of individual tuition from private tutors, and he gave a number of reasons for why this is the case, citing the value of competition and emulation among pupils,as well as the usefulness of group discussions and debates. Ibn Sīnā described the curriculum of a maktab school in some detail, describing the curricula for two stages of education in a maktab school.[45]</p></br>
<h2  style="text-align: center; font-size: 3cqw;">Primary education</h2> 
<center><img src="elementry.jpg" alt="Ahmed" width="500" height="200"></center>
<p>Ibn Sīnā wrote that children should be sent to a maktab school from the age of 6 and be taught primary education until they reach the age of 14.During which time, he wrote, they should be taught the Qur'an, Islamic metaphysics, Arabic, literature, Islamic ethics, and manual skills (which could refer to a variety of practical skills).[45]</p>
<h2  style="text-align: center; font-size: 3cqw;">Secondary education</h2>
<center> <img src="secondry.jpg" alt="Nabeel" width="500" height="200"></center>
<p>Ibn Sīnā refers to the secondary education stage of maktab schooling as a period of specialisation when pupilsh should begin to acquire manual skills, regardless of their social status. He writes that children after the age of 14 should be allowed to choose and specialise in subjects they have an interest in, whether it was reading, manual skills, literature, preaching, medicine, geometry, trade and commerce, craftsmanship,or any other subject or profession they would be interested in pursuing for a future career. He wrote that this was a transitional stage and that there needs to be flexibility regarding the age in which pupils graduate,as the student's emotional development and chosen subjects need to be taken into account.[46]</p>
<h2  style="text-align: center; font-size: 3cqw;">Higher education</h2> 
<center><img src="high.jpg" alt="Shoaib" width="500" height="200"></center>
<p>In Muslim India, the madrasa started off as providing higher education similarly to other parts of the Islamic world. The primary function for these institutions was to train and prepare workers for bureaucratic work as well as the judicial system. The curriculum generally consisted of logic, philosophy, law, history, politics, and particularly religious sciences,later incorporating more of mathematics, astronomy, geography, and medicine.Madrasas were often subsidized and founded by states or private individuals,and well-qualified teachers filled in the role for professors. Foundations of Islamic higher education in India is tied to the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate in 1206 which set a basis of importance for Muslim education. Under control of the Delhi Sultanate, two early important madrasas were founded. The first was the Muzziyya named after Muḥammad Ghuri of the Ghorid Dynasty and his title of Muʿizz al-Dīn and founded by Sultan Iltutmish.[54] The other madrasa was the Nāṣiriyya, named after Nāṣir al-Dīn Maḥmūd and built by Balban. These two madrasas bear importance as a starting point for higher education for Muslim India. Babur of the Mughal Empire founded a madrasa in Delhi which he specifically included the subjects of mathematics, astronomy, and geography besides the standard subjects of law, history,secular and religious sciences.[54] Although little is known about the management and inner workings of these places of Islamic higher education, religious studies bore the focus amongst most other subjects,particularly the rational sciences such as mathematics, logic, medicine, and astronomy.Although some tried to emphasize these subjects more, it is doubtful that every madrasa made this effort. While "madrasah" can now refer to any type of school,the term madrasah was originally used to refer more specifically to a medieval Islamic centre of learning,mainly teaching Islamic law and theology, usually affiliated with a mosque, and funded by an early charitable trust known as waqf.[55]</p>
<h2  style="font-size: 3cqw;">Madrasa and university</h2>
<img src="diobnd.jpg" alt="nbeel" width="600" height="200">...................<img src="uni.jpg" alt="Ahmed" width="600" height="200">
<p>Note: The word jāmiah (Arabic: جامعة) simply means 'university'. For more information, see Islamic university (disambiguation).Scholars like Arnold H. Green and Seyyed Hossein Nasr have argued that, starting in the tenth century, some medieval Islamic madrasas indeed became universities.[63][64] However, scholars like George Makdisi, Toby Huff and Norman Daniel[65][66] argue that the European medieval university has no parallel in the medieval Islamic world.[67][68] Darleen Pryds questions this view, pointing out that madrasas and European universities in the Mediterranean region shared similar foundations by princely patrons and were intended to provide loyal administrators to further the rulers' agenda.[69] Some other scholars regard the university as uniquely European in origin and characteristics. sity in Fez, present-day Morocco is recognised by many historians as the oldest degree-granting university in the world, having been founded in 859 as a mosque by Fatima al-Fihri.[75][76][77] While the madrasa college could also issue degrees at all levels, the jāmiʻahs (such as al-Qarawīyīn and al-Azhar University) differed in the sense that they were larger institutions, more universal in terms of their complete source of studies, had individual faculties for different subjects, and could house a number of mosques, madrasas, and other institutions within them.[55] Such an institution has thus been described as an "Islamic university".[78</p>
<h2  style="font-size: 3cqw;">Female education</h2>

<p>See also: Women in Islam, Women's literary salons and societies in the Arab world, and List of female Muslim scholars Prior to the 12th century, women accounted for less than one percent of the world's Islamic scholars. However,al-Sakhawi and Mohammad Akram Nadwi have since found evidence of over 8,000 female scholars since the 15th century.[113] al-Sakhawi devotes an entire volume of his 12-volume biographical dictionaryal-Ḍaw al-lāmi to female scholars, giving information on 1,075 of them.[114] More recently,the scholar Mohammad Akram Nadwi, currently a researcher from the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies,has written 40 volumes on the muḥaddithāt (the women scholars of hadith), and found at least 8,000 of them.[115]From around 750, during the Abbasid Caliphate, women "became renowned for their brains as well as their beauty".[11 In particular, many well known women of the time were trained from childhood in music, dancing and poetry.Mahbuba was one of these. Another female (albeit probably fictional) figure to be remembered for her achievementswas Tawaddud, "a slave girl who was said to have been bought at great cost by Hārūn al-Rashīd because she haspassed her examinations by the most eminent scholars in astronomy, medicine, law, philosophy, music, history.Arabic grammar, literature, theology and chess".[117] Moreover, among the most prominent feminine figures was Shuhda who was known as "the Scholar" or "the Pride of Women" during the 12th century in Baghdad.recogition of women's aptitudes during the Abbasid dynasty, all these came to an end in Iraq with the sack of Baghdad in 1286.According to the Sunni scholar Ibn Asākir in the 12th century, there were opportunities for female education.in the medieval Islamic world, writing that women could study, earn ijazahs (academic degrees), and qualify as scholars and teachers. This was especially the case for learned and scholarly families,who wanted to ensure the highest possible education for both their sons and daughters.[119]Ibn Asakir had himself studied under 80 different female teachers in his time. Female education in the Islamic world was inspired by Muhammad's wives, such as Khadijah, a successful businesswoman,and 'A'isha, a strong leader and interpreter of the Prophet's actions. According to a hadith attributed both to Muhammad and 'A'isha, the women of Medina were praiseworthy because of their desire for religious knowledge: Although female madrasas did exist before the 1970s large strides were made is regards to female education. After the 1970s a large increase in total female madrasas took plan expanded very rapidly across the region.[120][121]How splendid were the women of the ansar; shame did not prevent them from becoming learned in the faith.While it was not common for women to enroll as students in formal classes, it was common for women to attend informal lectures and study sessions at mosques,madrasas and other public places. While there were no legal restrictions on female education, some men did not approve of this practice, such as Muhammad ibn al-Hajj (d. 1336) who was appalled at the behaviour of some women who informally audited lectures in his time:[122]</p>
<h2  style="text-align: center; font-size: 3cqw;">Social life and the Madrese</h2>
<p>As with any other country during the Early Modern Period, such as Italy and Spain in Europe,the Ottoman social life was interconnected with the medrese. Medreses were built in as part of a Mosque complex where many programmes, such as aid to the poor through soup kitchens, were held under the infrastructure of a mosque, which reveals the interconnectedness of religion and social life during this period. "The mosques to which medreses were attached, dominated the social life in Ottoman cities."[151] Social life was not dominated by religion only in the Muslim world of the Ottoman Empire; it was also quite similar to the social life of Europe during this period. As Goffman says: "Just as mosques dominated social life for the Ottomans, churches andsynagogues dominated life for the Christians and Jews as well."[151] Hence, social life and the medrese wereclosely linked, since medreses taught many curricula, such as religion, which highly governed social life interms of establishing orthodoxy. "They tried moving their developing state toward Islamic orthodoxy."[151] Overall, the fact that mosques contained medreses comes to show the relevance of education to religion in the sense that education took place within the framework of religion and religion established social life by trying to create a common religious orthodoxy. Hence, medreses were simply part of the social life of society as students came to learn the fundamentals of their societal values.</p>
